# PTEN-AlternativeSplicing

This file contains the alternative splicing raw data and scripts for bioinformatic analysis for the study entitled, "Alternative Splicing
Landscape of the Neural Transcriptome in Cytoplasmic-Predominant Pten Expression Murine Model of Autism-like Behavior" 

The scripts concern our rMATs v. 4.0.2 pipeline, which takes BAM files aligned using STAR (mm10 gencode build) as input.
